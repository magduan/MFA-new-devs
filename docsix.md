# Adding Your Album Data

After creating your ```.csv``` file, you will need to place it where the application can access it. 
1. Rename your file to ```album-rankings.csv``` (if it is not already). 
2. Open the ```MyFavoriteAlbums``` folder on your computer. 
3. Go into the ```data``` subfolder.
4. Replace the existing ```album-rankings.csv``` file with your version.

Once your file is in place, the application will be able to find and load your album data when it runs.i
