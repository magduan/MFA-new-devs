# Privacy and Data Usage

MyFavoriteAlbums does not store or collect any personal information. All personal favorite album data is stored on your device in local storage, meaning this data remains private unless you decide to publish your web dashboard online and share it. We want to be completely transparent about how the album data is used in the apps, and if you are interested in digging through the source code, it is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/UW-Example-Student/MyFavoriteAlbums).
